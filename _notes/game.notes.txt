loopCycle function(){
    
    [0] = Start a new frame (while the previous frame is handled by the display).
    
    [1] = Go through the list of requestAnimationFrame callbacks and invoke them.
    
    [2] = Perform garbage collection and other per-frame tasks when the above callbacks stop controlling the main thread.
    
    [3] = Sleep (unless an event interrupts the browser's nap) until the monitor is ready for your image (VSync) and repeat.
}

loopCycle must refresh once 
    every 16-and-a-half milliseconds 
    to keep up with a 60 Hz display.


 

    1 second = 1000 milliseconds

    16.5 milliseconds = 0.0165 second

    refreshSyncPerSecond = 0.0165;




window.requestAnimationFrame() 
always provides a DOMHighResTimeStamp to callbacks as an argument when they are executed.
